This Repo is a complete distaster.  There are multiple mains, multiple Makefiles, and I don't even myself remember what's what anymore.  I think at least 50% of the files are unnecessary if your goal is just to render a black hole.  The code itself is also in serious need of a refactor.  But, if people actually use this and email me explaining their problems, I will read the emails, implement the changes, and this might gradually morph into something useable.

The code also can't be run as is because it depends on various textures which, although I paid for on Adobe Stock images, I'm not sure if I can legally distribute the textures.  So, at minimum main (whichever main is the real main) will need to be modified to take in user supplied textures.
